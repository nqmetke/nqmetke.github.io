# Introduction to this devlog
Hi there! My name is Nathanael, and I am a software engineer looking to broaden my skills. I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut. Since leaving school and getting settled into a new professional workflow, I have been looking for ways to work on personal projects, while documenting it as well. I am a big fan of the "working in the open" idea, so that is my goal for this. Occasionally, I will be posting updates to what I am working on, with all the screenshots, explanations, and GitHub links.


## Well, whats first?
I have focused a lot on web projects in my personal time, and embedded projects during my time at university. I am looking for something new, so I will be trying my hand at the Apple development process. At the same time, I am thinking about drafting plans for a hardware/embedded project. I will be posting updates about these ideas once they are more fully fleshed out. 

Hopefully, I will be updating this blog soon. But for now, this is all I have to say. Off to work getting these projects up and running!
